# Assignment: Introduction to Google Earth Engine with Jupyter Lab

Introduction to Python Notebooks for working with Google Earth Engine (GEE)

Read the docs and examples at https://github.com/cyverse-education/jupyterlab-gee

## Prerequisites
Create an account with Google Earth Engine using your arizona.edu account. https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/ - just enter your `<user>@email.arizona.edu` account and then select `Google Workspace account` at the next step. That will redirect to UA WebAuth and allow you to sign in with your NetID.

## Assignment
The assignment is to create:
1) cool map in the GEE javascript engine: https://code.earthengine.google.com/
Use the Examples. 

2) cool map in a Jupyter Notebook running in colab. 
Visit https://github.com/giswqs/earthengine-py-notebooks and explore some of the Notebooks. The notebooks will be rendered in github so you can just click on the "Colab" link at the top to run some. Be sure to install the `geema`p lbirary in the first cell since these will be bare docker containers running basic python without any geo libraries.
